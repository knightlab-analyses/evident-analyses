/home/grahman/miniconda3/envs/evident-analyses/lib/python3.7/site-packages/redbiom/commands/fetch.py:106: PerformanceWarning: DataFrame is highly fragmented.  This is usually the result of calling `frame.insert` many times, which has poor performance.  Consider joining all columns at once using pd.concat(axis=1) instead.  To get a de-fragmented frame, use `newframe = frame.copy()`
